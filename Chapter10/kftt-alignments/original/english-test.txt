Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA was the 3rd Seii Taishogun of the Muromachi Shogunate and reigned from 1368 to1394.
Official Rank: Juichii Daijodaijin (Chancellor of the Realm) and Zoshoichii
Title of Nobility: Monarch of Japan
Childhood name: Haruo
His farther was the 2nd Shogun, Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA, and his mother was KI no Yoshiko.
His wife was Nariko HINO, a daughter of the Dainagon (Great Councilor) Tokimitsu HINO, and she became his wife thanks to the arrangement and support of a beloved princess of the Emperor Go-Kogon, Senshi Hino.
After that, Yasuko Hino (later Kitayamain), her niece, became his wife after the death of Nariko.
His concubines were FUJIWARA no Keishi (Yoshiko) - mother of Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA and Yoshinori ASHIKAGA - and Kasuga no Tsubone (a concubine of Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA) - mother of Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA - among others.
Yoshimitsu was also called "Muromachi-dono" (Lord Muromachi), because he moved the Imperial Palace to Kitakoji Muromachi.
Later, "Muromachi-dono" became the designation for the ASHIKAGA Shogun, and his government office-cum-residence was called "Muromachi Bakufu," which has been used ever since as a historical term to indicate Muromachi Shogunate.
He was born in 1358.
It fell precisely on the 100th day after the death of Takauji ASHIKAGA.
When Yoshimitsu was young, there were constant struggles between the Muromachi Shogunate and the Yoshino Imperial Court, and moreover, since the Kanno Disturbance, an internal conflict of the ASHIKAGA family, had occurred, the strife between the Shogunate and the Court intensified.
Kiyouji HOSOKAWA and other potential military commanders supported the Southern Imperial Court, and in 1361, when Kiyouji and Masanori KUSUNOKI of the Southern Imperial Court occupied Kyoto, Yoshimitsu was obliged to escape to the Shirahata Castle in Harima Province.
The following year, he returned to Kyoto as the alliance of the Shogunate and Northern Court recaptured the capital. On the way back to Kyoto, when he spent a night in Settsu Province, he liked the scenery and said to the vassals, "there is very fine scenery here, let's carry it back to Kyoto.
"You should carry it on your shoulders," and the vassals, listening to him, were said to be very surprised at his grandiose thinking.
After his farther Yoshiakira died from an illness in 1367, Yoshimitsu became the 3rd Shogun at the age of 11.
In 1368 the Hyojohajime was celebrated, and in 1369 he was installed as Shogun.
While the administration of the Shogunate was led by Shugo Daimyos of the Ashikaga clan, including Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA, who were in charge of Kanrei, he studied imperial governance.
Yoriyuki implemented Oan no Taiho, a land expropriation law, to consolidate land management, and developed the Five Mountain System in Kyoto and Kamakura to strengthen control over religion.
He also dispatched Sadayo (Ryoshun) IMAGAWA and Yoshihiro OUCHI to Kyushu, where the Southern Court dominated, to debilitate its influence and consolidate the power of the Shogunate.
In 1374, he welcomed Yoriko HINO as his wife.
In 1370, in order to strengthen control over Kyoto, the Court gave him authority to control the Sanmon Kunin (a clique of influential people of Enryaku-ji Temple and its affiliates, as well as member of the temple)
In 1378, the Shogunate was moved from Sanjo Bomon to Kitanokoji Muromachi.
The Shogunate, after the move, was nicknamed "Hana no Gosho" (Flower Palace), and also called the Muromachi Bakufu (Shogunate) after its new location.
The administration and taxation authorities, which had been divided between the Court and the Shogunate, were integrated and a unit called Hokoshu or Bugyoshu was organized to handle practical matters, and was a standing army comparable to the Shugo Daimyo's army in military strength.
He also undertook the following actions to demonstrate his power: visit to Todai-ji Temple and Kofuku-ji Temple in 1385, sight-seeing trip to Mt. Fuji in Suruga Province in 1388, visit to Itsukushima Shrine in Aki Province in 1389.
In 1379, Yoshimitsu's residence was surrounded by the anti-Yoriyuki Shugo Daimyos such as Yoshiyuki (Yoshimasa) SHIBA and Yoriaki TOKI, who requested that he dismiss Yoriyuki, and consequently Yoriyuki was dismissed (Koryaku Political Change).
Yoshimasa succeeded to the post of Kanrei and personnel matters were taken over by the SHIBA clique.
The Shogunate issued an order to hunt and kill Yoriyuki, but the following year pardoned him and after that he was included again in the administration with the post of shukuro, and during this period Yoshimitsu was able to establish his power as Shogun; and based on these facts we can assume that he might have intended to make use of the rivalry between the two factions, SHIBA and HOSOKAWA, to get them to contain each other.
After the death of Yoriyasu, he subdued the TOKI clan, taking advantage of the internal conflict while the TOKI were fighting on two sides.
In 1391, he intervened in the internal conflict of the YAMASHINAs and provoked Ujikiyo YAMANA, a powerful Shugo Daimyo dominating 11 provinces at that time who was called "Rokubun no ichi dono" (Lord of one-sixth of the whole country) to raise an army to subdue the YAMANAs.
Yoshimitsu was again promoted and took the position of Naidaijin (minister of internal affairs) and Sadaijinn (minister of the left), the higher official rankings that his grandfather and his father were not able to achieve.
In 1383 he was the first samurai to become Genjichoja (Head of the Genjis), and served concurrently as Betto (supreme officer) of the Junan-in and the Shogaku-in, and later he was granted a title "Jusango," and reached the height of power of the samurai as well as the aristocrats.
In 1392, Yoshimitsu accelerated negotiations with the Southern Court with a help of Yoshihiro OUCHI as an intermediary, as the national influence of the Southern Court was declining. In the negotiations, he presented several following proposals for reconciliation: the emperor should be selected alternately from the two imperial lineages, Jimyoin-to and Daikakuji-to; all the state-owned territories (of which there was actually very little) should belong to the Daikakuji-to; the Three Sacred Treasures which were in the possession of Emperor Go-Kameyama should be presented to Emperor Go-Komatsu of the Jimyoin-to, so that the Southern Court would be dissolved. In this way, he achieved integration of the Northern and Southern Courts, and put a stop to the 58 year split between the courts.
After Emperor Go-Enyu, who opposed Yoshimitsu and abdicated to Emperor Go-Komatsu, died in 1393, Yoshimitsu established his power, and in 1394, he handed over the post of Shogun to his son, Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA, and retired, but he continued to hold the real power.
The same year, he finally rose to the post of Juichii Daijodaijin (Chancellor of the Realm).
The following year, he became a priest with a pseudonym, Dogi.
It is thought that he became a priest in order to gain the ability to control temples and shrines, the remaining sphere he wanted to conquer after reaching the peak of the aristocratic spheres as Seii Taishogun, Taisei daijin and Junsangu.
Following Yoshimitsu's act, many samurai and aristocrats also became priests.
In 1395, Sadayo IMAGAWA, who held independent authority as Kyushu Tandai, was dismissed.
In 1399, he provoked a powerful Daimyo in the western region, Yoshihiro OUCHI, and using the excuse that Yoshihiro was taking up arms, he subdued Yoshihiro (War of Oei), and in this way the influential factions that might oppose Yoshimitsu in the western region were eliminated.
Yoshimitsu, since his younger days, had deeply admired Ming, wishing to establish trade between Japan and Ming. However, the government of Ming recognized Prince Kanenaga sole counterpart for negotiations, therefore, Yoshimitsu's wish was not fulfilled.
After the integration of the Northern and Southern Courts, he again intended to negotiate with Ming, under the nominal title of "Seii Shogun of Japan, Yoshimitsu MINAMOTO," but the government of Ming would not accept an envoy dispatched by someone who presented himself as a vassal of the Emperor, because Ming traditionally did not trade with any retainer of a vassal.
Then, Yoshimitsu became a priest, and then sent a merchant called Koitsumi from Hakata City and the priest Soa as missionaries to Ming in 1401, with the aristocratic title of "Junsangu of Japan, Michiyoshi MINAMOTO," instead of using the higher (but samurai) title of "Taisei Shogun."
Finally Emperor Jianwen of Ming offered a master-and-man relationship (sakuho) to the Japanese sovereign instead of to Prince Kanenaga, with whom Ming had wanted to have contact until then, and when Ming gave the Datongli calendar to Japan, the two countries' diplomatic relations were formally established.
In 1404, he started Japan-Ming trade that took the form of tribute to the Ming emperor. He also was able to suppress Japanese pirates (however, before the Ming's government could dispatch an envoy to convey the emperor's gratitude to the Japanese government, the Seinan War broke out in Ming, Emperor Jianwen abdicated, and Emperor Yongle took the throne).
After the abolition of the embassies to China, in the Japanese aristocratic society, in which an isolation policy was practiced based on a petit Sino centrism, there were accumulated discontent with and criticism of the tribute trade because Japan was treated as vassal to the emperors of Ming; but, as the aristocrats were not able to speak out publicly in the face of the Yoshimitsu's strong influence, they could do nothing but comment on their dissatisfaction in diaries or other documents.
Yoshimitsu, who adored Ming culture, pressed the Imperial Court to use the Chinese character 洪 in the name of Japanese eras after the Taizu of Ming, Emperor Hongwu (洪武帝), but this was rejected by for various reasons, including the facts mentioned above.
Yoshimitsu felt offended, and after that, he was never allowed to change the name of the era during his reign, and that is why the Oei was the longest era before Meiji.
In 1397, he received Hokusantei in Kitayama, Kyoto, from Kintsune SAIONJI, and constructed a mountain villa called Kitayamatei or Kitayamadono (later Rokuon-ji Temple), placing a reliquary in the center.
The culture of this period is called the Kitayama Culture, where the samurai style, aristocratic style and the Tang style (Zen Buddhism style) were merged.
In 1408, he died of a sudden illness in his 51st calendar year (49 years old).
Buddhist name: Rokuonin Tenzan Dogi.
After the death of Yoshimitsu, the title "Rokuonin Daijohoo (Cloistered Emperor)" was granted from the Imperial Court, but his son Yoshimochi, who became the fourth Shogun, declined the offer partly because Yoshiyuki (Yoshimasa) SHIBA and others opposed accepting the title (on the other hand, his family temple, Shokoku-ji Temple seems to have accepted the title and therefore, Yoshimitsu's name is registered as "Rokuonin Daijo Tenno" in the temple's death register).
It is said that during his life Yoshimitsu did not get along well with his son Yoshimochi, and the policies that Yoshimitsu introduced, such as the Imperial Court policy, control of the aristocracy and Shugo Daimyo, and foreign policy including trade with Ming, were denounced by Yshimochi.
The Hokusantei, a heritage left by Yoshimitsu, was also destroyed by Yoshimochi, except for the Kinkaku.
In his life, Yoshimitsu was extremely partial to Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA, his second son, and when Yoshitsugu absconded, Yoshimochi accused him of treason and killed him.
Afterwards, the descendants of Yoshitsugu fled to Echizen, and they were called "Kuradanigosho."
Yoshimitsu's son, Yoshinori ASHIKAGA, intended to continue Yoshimitsu's policies when he became the 6th Shogun, but he was assassinated by Mitsusuke AKAMATSU during the Kakitsu War.
Yoshimitsu's grandson, Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA who became the 8th Shogun, also tried to follow his grandfather and father's policies, but as he became disgusted with the Onin War and the puppet administration controlled by his vassals, he lost enthusiasm for political management.
The Shugo Daimyos, who had served submissively during Yoshimitsu's reign, began to take a defiant attitude toward the government again.
Yoshinari TANAKA, Akira IMATANI, and others propose a theory that Yoshimitsu had an intention to usurp the imperial throne; and based on this theory, some novelists including Chogoro KAIONJI and Motohiko IZAWA present their opinion that Yoshimitsu's sudden death might confirm that he was assassinated to interrupt his plot.
Yoshimitsu, from his younger days, was accustomed to using wither of two stylized signatures according to the situation, one for samurai affairs and the other for aristocratic affairs. He also made his second wife, Yasuko, become the Emperor Go-Komatsu's junbo (mother next to the Empress, treated as his mother), then made her a Nyoin (wife of a former Emperor or princess who received the same treatment as Emperors). He also forced the nobles to offer their wives to him.
He also usurped various authorities, such as those for rituals and for personnel affairs, from the Imperial Family. In April 1408, one month before his death, he carried out the ceremony of Genpuku (coming-of-age ceremony for boys) for his second son, Yoshitsugu, on a scale comparable to ceremonies for an imperial prince.
It is thought that all of this was done by Yoshimitsu with the intention of usurping the throne, and becoming Ming's hosaku is also supposed to have been planned as a part of his plot, in order to make use of external pressure on the imperial court.
Those who support the assassination theory suspect that Yoshimitsu was poisoned by the Imperial Court, who wanted to prevent his usurpation (IZAWA deduces in his novel that the assassin was Zeami).
There is another theory in which Yoshimochi's side was worried about the future succession due to Yoshimitsu's excessive partiality to Yoshitsugu.
However, there were no descriptions in any documents of that period, such as nobles' diaries, indicating suspicion that the actions taken by Yoshimitsu had been a part of his plot or that he was assassinated, and therefore, they cannot offer any direct evidence either.
By the way, usurpation here does not mean that Yoshimitsu himself wanted to take to the throne, but he wanted to take authority from the emperors by acquiring power as a sort of retired sovereign, and intended to hold real power even after his retirement.
He tried to make his second son, Yoshitsugu, accede to the throne, while he himself, being his father, intended to be a retired sovereign.
IMATANI supposes that Yoshimitsu was strongly influenced by China (Ming), but he did not subscribe to idea that incumbent emperors could be overthrown by decree of heaven, instead making use of "Yamataishi," a popular prophecy of the time.
This verse is known as a prophecy, where it is predicted that the imperial reign would count 100 emperors, and according today's study, the Emperor Go-Komatsu is considered to be the 100th emperor.
However, because the reigns of the Kobun, Junnin, and Chukyo were not recognized at the time, and the Muromachi Shogunate naturally saw the Northern Court as legitimate, Emperor Go-Komatsu was considered to be the 99th.
But, if the temporary unification of Emperor Go-Murakami in the Shohei unification during the Civil war of Kanno is counted, then Emperor Go-Komatsu is the 100th emperor.
Thus, it could be interpreted to mean that Japan would be ruined after a monkey or dog had been called a hero.
The idea that the imperial reign terminates with the 100th emperor is documented in Gukansho by Jien and other writings, and is supposed to have been widely accepted.
Ujimitsu ASHIKAGA, the Kamakura Kubo, was born in the year of the monkey, according to the Chinese zodiac (nowadays, he is considered to have been born in the year of boar), while Yoshimitsu was born in the year of dog; therefore, there was an interpretation that the monkey and the dog represent these two people.
On the other hand, IZAWA supposes that the author might have gotten the hint from The Tale of Genji.

Information
Located in the Higashiyama Ward of Kyoto City, Sanjyo-Keihan Station is a stop on the Tozai Line, a Kyoto Municipal Subway Line.
The station number is T11.
The Keihan Electric Railway
Keihan Main Line and Keihan Oto Line in Sanjyo Station (in Kyoto Prefecture)
An underground concourse outside its ticket gate connects Sanjyo-Keihan Station to Sanjyo Station.
The platform is located on the fourth underground level, as are the platforms of other stations on the Tozai Line. Equipped with safety measures, the platform is what is known as an 'Island Platform,' which is a single platform between double tracks (one platform serving two tracks that run in opposite directions).
Each station on the Tozai Line has its own color, and the color used at Sanjyo-Keihan Station is scarlet tinged with purple.
Refer to Sanjyo-Keihan for details on the station's surroundings, including the location of the bus station.
Kyoto City Bus and other public transport firms have been calling this spot "Sanjyo-Keihan" since before the subway line was opened.
The municipal subway chose to use the name Sanjyo-Keihan because Keihan was the name of another railway company and there was already a station named Sanjyo in Kyoto prefecture.
The station opened on October 12, 1997, when the Tozai Line began operating between Daigo Station and Nijyo Station.
On April 1, 2007, PiTaPa card was made available.
The station facilities were built by Historical Corporation of Tozai Line of Kyoto Municipal Subway Lines, a third sector company.
The Keihan Keishin Line uses the same tracks as the Tozai Line. They originally planned to share the tracks to this station because the Keihan Keishin Line ran between Misasagi Station and this station, which was above ground at the time. However, as they were unable to secure enough space around this area for a turnaround, the Keihan Keishin Line decided to extend the shared section to the next station, Kyoto Shiyakusyo-mae, when Sanjyo-Keihan Station was opened. (They later extended the shared section even further to Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station when the Tozai Line was extended to that station in 2008.)

Sanyodo (Senyodo or Kagetomo-no-michi) can mean:
A region of Honshu along the Seto Inland Sea that was one of the Goki-Shichido (literally, "five provinces and seven circuits") administrative divisions.
A highway that traversed Sanyodo, which was one of the Goki-Shichido.
A route built during the Ritsuryo period.
A route built in the Edo period (Saigoku-kaido).
An abbreviation for "Sanyo Jidoshado Expressway."
Administrative division
See also: List of ryoseikoku
One of the Goki-Shichido, referring to a region of Honshu along the Seto Inland Sea
The region west of Kinai and along the Seto Inland Sea, from present-day West Hyogo Prefecture to Yamaguchi Prefecture, was collectively called Sanyodo.
Harima-no-kuni
Mimasaka-no-kuni - separated from Bizen-no-kuni in 713.
Bizen-no-kuni
Bichu-no-kuni
Bingo-no-kuni
Aki-no-kuni
Suo-no-kuni
Nagato-no-kuni
During the Ritsuryo period the Sanyodo connected Kinai (Naniwa-kyo, Heijo-kyo, and Heian-kyo) and North Kyushu (Dazaifu and Hakata).
The Sanyodo was only the first graded highway among the Shichido, and as such it was regarded as the most important because of the expected passage and stays of foreign missions.
The eastern end of the road varied in response to the transfer of capitals such as Heijo-kyo and Heian-kyo.
The ancient Sanyodo was approximately six to nine meters wide and generally straight in such a way that Kokufu and other areas throughout the region could be connected efficiently.
The Sanyodo stretched northwest from Harima-no-kuni to Mimasaka-no-kuni, which was away from the main route.
The Edo shogunate improved the Sanyodo as part of its road maintenance policy, which focused on five major highways.
There were 42 yadoeki along the highway.
During the Edo period, the Sanyodo (otherwise known as Saigoku-kaido) connected Kyoto to Shimonoseki City and further extended to Kokura City by crossing the Kammon-kaikyo Strait from Shimonoseki.
This route was part of the truck line linking Edo and Nagasaki City.
The Meiji government started its road management system by assigning numbers to national highways.
During the Meiji period, the Sanyodo of the Edo period and earlier became a section of National Highway 3 connecting Tokyo City and Kobe City (separating from National Highway 2 in Kyoto City); and of National Highway 4 connecting Tokyo and Nagasaki City; during the Taisho period it was integrated into National Highway 2 connecting Tokyo and Kagoshima City (separating from National Highway 1 in Mie Prefecture).
The Sanyodo has been passed down to National Highway 2 today, which connects Osaka City and Kita Kyushu City.
Its route, however, differs from that of the Ritsuryo and Edo periods in many places.
National Highway 2 from Okayama City (Okayama Prefecture) to Fukuyama City (Hiroshima Prefecture) takes a very different route (Kamogata-orai Route).
The Sanyo Jidoshado Expressway and the railway lines of the Sanyo Main Line and the Sanyo Shinkansen Line roughly follow the historical Sanyodo.
The Sanyodo has served its function of connecting the Kinki region and Kyushu since the Ritsuryo period, and it continues in that manner today.
When people say "Sanyodo" today, they are generally referring to the Sanyo Jidoshado Highway.
The historical Sanyodo and the roads running in parallel with it are collectively called "Old Sanyodo" in Okayama Prefecture and East Hiroshima Prefecture, because National Highway 2 does not follow it between Okayama City (Okayama Prefecture) and Fukuyama City (Hiroshima Prefecture).
Kurama-dera Temple is a buddhist temple located in Kurama Honmachi, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It used to belong to Tendai Sect, but since 1949 it became independent and is now the Head Temple of Kurama-kokyo Sect.
Sango is Mount Kurama.
It is said to have been established by Gantei, a leading disciple of Ganjin.
In this temple, the Honzon (main image of worship) is referred to as "Sonten."
"Sonten" is said to be the Honzon that is a Trinity of Vaisravana, Saharabhuja and Goho Maoson.
Is located at the north of Kyoto Basin, on the sourthern slope of Mount Kurama, where rich natural environment remains.
Kurama is also famous as the place where Ushiwakamaru (MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune) trained himself, and it is also known as the setting for Jiro OSARAGI's book, "Kurama Tengu."
It is the No. 19 New Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage Site.
It operates a cable car (Mount Kurama Cable Railway) transportation to Kurama Temple, and it is the only religious corporation which operates a railway business.
Various books including "Konjaku Monogatarishu" and "Fusoryakuki" describe the beginning of Kurama Temple, and it is said that a person named FUJIWARA no Isendo, who came from Fujiwara Nanke and served as the Head of Zoto-ji Temple, enshrined Vaisravana and sahasrabhuja, and built Kurama Temple.
However, "Anbagaiji engi", handed down for many generations in the temple, tells another story about the start of the temple, which is that Gantei, a high disciple of Ganjin, built a cottage in the 1st Year of Hoki, and enshrined Vaisravana.
Gantei was the youngest among the eight high disciples who Ganjin brought back with him from Tang (present day China).
One night, in the third year of Hoki, Gantei saw a spiritual dream, which told him that there is a spiritual mountain in the north of Yamashiro Province.
Gantei, who set off to visit the spiritual mountain, saw a white horse with a saddle made by treasures on top of a mountain.
That was Mount Kurama.
Gantei, on entering the mountain, was attacked and nearly killed by an ogre who took the form of a woman, but when he was in extreme danger, a dead tree fell down and crushed the ogre.
The next morning, a statue of Vaisravana was there, and it is said that Gantei built a temple to worship this statue.
This story about Gantei is only seen in "Anbagaiji engi", and it is not clear how far it tells an actual historical event.
Nevertheless, it is notable that a priest of South Capital (Nara) took part in establishing the temple, as in the case of the establishment of KiyomizuTemple.
Later, in 796, FUJIWARA no Isendo, who was in charge of building an official temple, To-ji Temple, wished to build a temple to place a Kannon that he personally worshiped.
Isendo, in accordance with a message revealed to him in a spiritual dream one night, followed a white horse and arrived at Mount Kurama, upon which he saw a small shrine that housed Vaisravana.
Isendo became suspicious saying, "I worship Kannon, but it is Vaisravana that is worshipped here."
However, in his dream that night, a child appeared and told him that "Kannon and Vaisravana have different names, but fundamentally they are one and the same."
Thus it is said that Isendo made a statue of sahasrabhuja and enshrined it together with Vaisravana.
Kurama-dera Temple became a temple of Shingon Sect from around the time when Priest Buen of To-ji Temple entered Kurama Temple during Kanpyo era (from 889 to 897) at the end of the 9th Century, but it changed to Tendai Sect in the 12th Century; since then it has been under the control of Shoren-in for a long time.
It appears to have attracted worshippers widely during the latter half of Heian period, as can seen by the fact that Emperor Shirakawa came to worship in 1091 and Moromichi FUJIWARA, the Kanpaku, in 1099.
"The Pillow Book" names the Front Approach of Ninety-nine Prayers of Kurama Temple as an example of "something which is near but also far".
Kurama Temple has been burned down many times, including by the fire of Year 1126.
In 1812 (ninth year of Bunka of Edo period), there was a great fire that engulfed the whole mountain in flames, and more recently, the Main Shrine was burned down by a fire in Year 1945.
Therefore, all the buildings are new, but many cultural properties such as statues of the Buddha have been preserved.
Koun SHIGARAKI, a chief priest in the Showa era, started Kurama-kokyo Sect in 1947.
In 1949 the temple became independent from Tendai Sect and is now the Head Temple of Kurama-kokyo Sect.
In Mount Kurama, located in the mountains of Kyoto, mountain ascetic hermits actively practiced Vajrayana Buddhism.
Therefore, it is said that Tengus, who are spirits of the mountains, live in Kurama.
The highest-ranking Tengu that lives in Kurama is called Sojobo, and Mount Kurama is said to be one of the most supreme mountains for Tengu.
Kurama-dera Temple, located north of Kyoto, was initially a temple with Vaisravana (of the Four Heavenly Kings, the King protecting the north-side) as its Honzon, and it also enshrined Saharabhuja and Goho Maoson.
However, form of worship at the current Kurama Temple after the establishment of Kurama-kokyo is unique, and some explanation is necessary regarding its Honzon.
According to the explanation by the temple after the establishment of Kurama-kokyo, the Honzon of Kurama Temple Main Shrine Golden Hall (the Main Shrine) is said to be "Sonten."
Within the shrine, Vaisravana is enshrined in the center, Saharabhuja is on the right side facing it, and Goho Maoson on the left side, and the three are collectively referred to as "Sonten."
"Sonten" is said to be "the cosmic energy that gives lfe and existence."
Moreover, Vaisravana represents the Spirit of Sunlight that symbolizes "Light" Saharabhujarepresents the Sprit of Moonlight that symbolizes "Love", and Maoson represents the Spiritual King of Earth that symbolizes "Power."
The power of "Sonten" is believed to exist everywhere, and since this power is especially strong in this area Kurama-dera Temple is said to be a place of practice where one can be surrounded by such power.
It is said that Goho Maoson, one of the Sonten, came to Earth from Venus 6.5 million years ago (not "650 years" ago); its body is formed from elements different from those ordinary human beings, and it is said to be in an eternal existence at the age of 16 and it does not age.
Vaisravana, Saharabhuja and Goho Maoson that are enshrined in Golden Hall of the Main Shrine are all secret Buddha statues [not open for public viewing]; in their stead statues referred to as "Omae-dachi" are enshrined in front of these secret Buddha Statues.
Omae-dachi Maoson statue looks like an unworldly person, with wings on its back, and a long beard, and has a high nose.
The aureola is made from tree leaves.
Goho Maoson enshrined in Two-storied pagoda has a similar form.
Therefore, it is believed that "Kurama Tengu" was initially Goho Maoson.
Although it is said to be 16 years old, it looks aged.
Nio-mon was burned down in 1891, and rebuilt in 1911.
The cable car from Sanmon Station to Tahoto Station started operating in 1957.
Tahoto was rebuilt in 1959.
Great Hall was rebuilt in Year 1971.
Shinden was built in 1924.
Tenhorindo Hall was rebuilt in 1969.
Mao-den of penetralia is a small shrine on top of a oddly-shaped rock located on a mountain road on the way from the Main Shrine to Kibune Shrine in the West.
It enshrines Maoson, which is said to have arrived on Earth from Venus 6.5 million years ago.
The current building was rebuilt after being burnt down in 1945.
Reihoden Hall is located at the back of the Main Shrine.
On the 1st Floor there is Kuramayama Museum, which has an exhibition of the animals and plants of Mount Kurama.
The 2nd Floor houses Temple Treasure Exhibit Room and Yosano Memorial Hall, which exhibits articles, and other items left by Tekkan YOSANO and Akiko YOSANO (Koun SHIGARAKI, who started Kurama-kokyo Sect, was a poet who studied under the YOSANO's).
On the 3rd Floor there is a sanctuary of Buddhist statues, which exhibits cultural properties including three standing statues: Wooden statue of Bishamonten, Wooden statue of Kosshouten, and Wooden statue of Zennishi-doji.
There is a view that the Honzon of Kurama-dera Temple were these three statues of Bishamonten, and there is another view that the Honzon probably looked similar to the Tobatsu-Bishamonten of the latter half of Heian era, which is an Important Cultural Property; this statue is also enshrined in Reihoden Hall.
Articles excavated from the Ruin of Kyozuka, which are items born from the idea of the Latter Day of the Law during the latter half of the Heian period can also be seen here.
Also, Akiko YOSANO's library, named "Tohaku-tei", has been moved from its original location and reconstructed in front of Reihoden Hall.
Wooden statue of Bishamonten, Wooden statue of Kosshouten, and Wooden statue of Zennishi-doji.

This is not sponsored by Kurama-dera Temple.
From within Kyoto City to the front of Kurama Temple.
From Demachiyanagi Station of Eizan Electric Railway, Kurama Line, it takes approximately 30 minutes to arrive at Kurama Station.
It takes 1 minute by foot to go from the station to Nio-mon (Main Gate).
From Nio-mon to Main Shrine Golden Hall (on foot).
Nio-mon (0) - 287m - Yuki Shrine (50) - 791m - Main Shrine Golden Hall (160)
The numbers in brackets are altitude measurements based on that of Nio-mon (unit: m).
The road is basically unpaved mountain road, although it is partially paved by stone.
It will take a grown man about 30 minutes to travel all the way on foot.
From Nio-mon to Main Shrine Golden Hall (by cable car).
Nio-mon(Sanmon Station)(0) - 200m - Tahoutou Station (120) - 456m - Main Shrine Golden Hall(160)
The numbers in brackets are altitudes measurements based on that of Nio-mon (unit: m).
Because it is hard to visit and worship on foot for the elderly people, cable car (Mount Kurama Cable Railway) is operates between Nio-mon and Two-storied Pagoda.
The time spent in the cable car is only about 2 minutes, and those who contribute 100 yen to the temple can ride the cable car for free (essentially, the fare is 100 yen one way).
From the Two-storied Pagoda to Main Shrine Golden Hall, you need to walk about 10 minutes on a stone paved road.
If you are visiting and worshipping on foot, you need to go via Yuki Shrine.
The temple encourages people who can walk the distance, not to use the cable car and visit and worship the temple on foot.
Access from Kibune side
Kibune Shrine (35) - 573m - Mao-den (185) - 460m - Sekurabe ishi(235) - 404m - Main Shrine Golden Hall(160)
The numbers in brackets are altitudes measurements based on that of Nio-mon (unit: m).
The entrance from Kibune side is called Nishi-mon.
This route is said to be the route that Ushiwakamaru ran, when he trained with Tengu.
As you will be crossing one mountain, it will be harder than climbing from the Kurama side.
It will take about 50 minutes on foot, even for a grown man.

College
Outline
Kyoto Institute of Technology (KIT) has only one school, that is, School of Science and Technology, so it's not that big in scale, but its education and research are unique in pursuing "practical science" based on creating products, ranging widely from the cutting-edge science and technology, such as biotechnology, material, information, and environment, to formative arts and design.
And, having the departments related to art, KIT tries "the fusion of science and art" through its organic education curriculum, attempting to become an international, sensibility-rich institute.
History
In 1899, Kyoto College of Textile Fibers was founded.
In 1902, Kyoto College of Technology was founded.
In 1914, Kyoto Institute of Textile Fibers was founded.
In 1931, Kyoto Institute of Textile Fibers was renamed Kyoto Institute of Textile Thread.
In 1944, Kyoto College of Technology was renamed Kyoto Vocational College of Technology, and Kyoto Institute of Textile Thread was renamed Kyoto Vocational College of Textile.
In 1949, based on two vocational colleges above, KIT started as a college under the new system, and opened School of Engineering and Design, and School of Textile Science.
In 1951, Technical College of KIT was established within the premises.
In 1992, Technical College of KIT was closed.
In 2004, KIT was transformed into the national university corporation by the National University Corporation Law.
In 2006, School of Engineering and Design, and School of Textile Science were united into School of Science and Technology.

"Joint Projects between Students and Teachers" are KIT-sponsored activities in which its students and teachers team up for taking part in events or contests related to manufacturing held outside of KIT.
The activities started in 2006.
ROBOCON TRIAL PROJECT()
In April, 2006, Associate Professor Yuichi SAWADA proposed the project, and it started as a cooperative one between students and teachers.
In June, 2006, they took part in College Category of NHK Robot Contest 2007 in Tokyo.
In the preliminary, they won with a score of 1-0 against Chiba University's team, and then won with the same score against Kanagawa Institute of Technology's team, so they were qualified for the championship tournament at the seventh rank.
But in the championship tournament, they were defeated with a score of 30-0 against Kanazawa Institute of Technology's team, the champion 2007.
STUDENT FORMULA PROJECT()
In Autumn, 2005, "Grandelfino" was founded as a team for producing a student formula car by like-minded people in KIT, gathered by its car club members,
In Summer, 2007, Grandelfino took part in Student Formula SAE Competition of JAPAN.
And its car managed to run till the end of the Endurance Check Category of the Competition, in which 28 teams did the same.
It ranked the 52nd out of 61 teams.
The team's name Grandelfino is a coinage made of the words "Delfino", an Italian word for dolphin, and "Grand", meaning great or magnificent.
Note : For now, many KIT students don't know about the actual conditions of this project.
Matsugasaki Festival
It's held over three days from the third Friday until Sunday every November.
KIT is off not only on those three days but on the day before and after the festival for its preparation and cleanup.

Notes
KIT, Shinshu University, and Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, are praised as classic 3 textile colleges.
Kenichi FUKUI, the Nobel prize winner, has ever acted as the president of KIT.
In fiscal Heisei 19, KIT ranked the first of all national colleges at the number of successful candidates who took the test of the first-class registered architect.
(Including private ones, KIT ranked the 3rd.)
Myo (妙) and Ho (法), known as "Gozan no Okuribi", can be seen nearby from the campus.
Honchi-suijaku is one of the thoughts of Shinbutsu-shugo (the amalgamation of Buddhism with Shinto) that emerged during the era in which Buddhism flourished in Japan; it supports the view that yao yorozu no kami (eight million gods) are Gongens, the embodiment of various types of Buddhas (including Bosatsu (Bodhisattva) and Tenbu (Deva)), which appeared in the land that was Japan.
Summary
Honchi indicates the state of enlightenment, while Suijaku, which literally means "bringing down jaku (Ato)," indicates the appearance of Shinto and Buddhist deities.
The ultimate Honchi is considered to be Hossin (the truth of the universe) and is therefore called Honchi-hossin.
As the "gon" of Gongen means "provisional" or "temporary," as shown in "Gon-dainagon (an acting chief councilor of state), Gongen indicates a Buddha that has tentatively appeared in the form of a god.
The concept of Honchi originated from the inclusive nature of Buddhism, which encompassed a wide range of indigenous religions as it spread throughout the region.
This is evidenced by the fact that most Buddhist Tenbu (Deva) gods originate from Hindu, India's indigenous religion.
The thought also gave rise to a theory of esoteric Buddhism (of the later Mahayana Buddhism) that Kajishin like Fudo myo-o (Acala) is the embodiment of Dainichi nyorai (Vairocana).
On the other hand, the concept of Suijaku came from a Chinese character, 迹 (jaku), which first appeared in the Tenun chapter of "Soshi (Zhuang-zi)" or in its phrase of '所以迹' (the path of edification), and was later referred to by Guo Xiang of West Jin, the writer of "Zhuang-zi Commentary" who developed his own theory in the chapter of "Seong-wang (Daiseigaio)" and defined jaku as a royal reign, citing "所以迹" as a born saint.
It was Seng-zhao, of the late Qin, who first brought the concept to Buddhism.
Seng-zhao cited, in his writing "Chuyuimakitsukyo (Vimalak?rti Sutra commentary)," the idea of "Honmatsu," which had been referred to by Wang Bi of Wei, and other scholars replaced the word "所以迹" with "本" (hon) and defined it (hon) as an unfathomable nirvana (enlightenment) achieved by Bodhisattva and "迹" (jaku) as a means to enlighten people, as used by Bodhisattva.
His theory, as endorsed by Hokekyo (Lotus Sutra), which supports Kuon jitsujo--a view that Buddha had been in nirvana long before he was born into this world--further influenced Zhiyi of the Chinese Tendai Sect, thus providing a basis for the development of Hokekyo's educational interpretations and the division of its scripture into "Jaku-mon" (the first half) and "Hon-mon" (the second half).
This created a widely accepted view that Hon is the Buddha or enlightenment itself while Jaku is simply a means by which to save and enlighten people.
In Japan, as is evident in the confrontation between the Mononobe clan and the Soga clan during the Nara era, there has been a dividing line between Shinto and Buddhism since it was officially introduced to Japan.
However, the line was gradually eroded as the Buddhists took the view that Shinto gods are a kind of lost, poor people, like the Tenbu (Deva) gods.
They tried to raise their status to that of the Buddha by leaving copies of sutras at temples or doing Doso, officially acknowledging the gods' achievements and stating in oracles that they would no longer stay as a god thanks to Buddha's good deeds.
In the Tenmu period of the late seventh century, when the Emperor-centered political regime was put in place, the Shinto gods that had played important roles in building the country--including Amaterasu Omikami, the highest ranking Ujigami (local god) of all--were elevated in status to ethnic gods, and this encouraged Buddhists to give them higher ranking as a token of respect.
Because these gods were considered to be members of the Goho zenjin, a group of gods who respected and guarded the Buddhist law, some were even granted Bosatsu-go (the title of Bodhisattva) from the end of the Nara era through the Heian era.
A typical example of this is Hachimanshin, a famous ethnic god also known as Hachiman Daibosatsu.
However, some low-profile minor ethnic gods, like the spirits of nature and death, to whom the Honchi-suijaku theory was not applied, were treated differently.
They are, for example, Jitsurui no kami (Jitsurui gods) or Jissha no kami (Jissha gods), as opposed to Gonsha no kami.
To make their position clear, some Buddhists codified a warning that permitted people to respect Gongeshin but not Jitsurui no kami.
This must have been an intentional effort to keep Buddhism separate from Shinto.
The theory of Honji-suijaku affected art and architecture, giving birth to Honchi-suijaku zuga (pictures) and Gongen-zukuri (buildings), and during the middle and end of the Kamakura era it affected literature as well, resulting in a series of works called Honchimono.
By the middle of the Kamakura era there appeared a group of people who insisted in the Shinpon butsujaku theory that Buddhas were in turn the embodiment of Shinto gods and that Shinto gods were the masters that Buddhas followed.
This theory was originated by Shinto people who had complained about Buddhism, which had been dominant over Shinto, and wanted Shinto to achieve independent status from it.
The Watarai clan, who had served as priests of Gegu (the outer shrine of Ise jingo) organized and re-edited myths and the records of Shinto ceremonies in order to compile the Shinto Gobusho (five-volume apologia of Shinto); their work laid the foundation for Ise Watarai Shinto.
Additionally, an attempt was made to theorize Shinto by borrowing the doctrine of the Tendai sect, which had adopted the reality-affirming Hongaku philosophy, and to re-edit several kinds of theory books by falsely attributing them to Kukai; but later these works were organized by Yukitada and Ieyuki WATARAI.
From the period of the Northern and Southern Courts through the Muromachi era, the anti-Honchi-suijaku theory increasingly gained ground to the point where some monks of the Tendai sect supported it.
Jihen, the author of "Kujihongi Gengi" and "Toyowashihara Shinpuwaki," converted to Shinto; and Ryohen of the Tendai sect, the author of "Jindai no maki shikenbun" and "Tenchi reiki kibunsho," supported his theory.
Following these moves, Kanetomo YOSHIDA wrote the book titled "Yuiitsu shinto myoho yoshu (The Only Shinto Scripture)," making Jihen's theory more complete and comprehensive.
However, new Buddhist schools that emerged during the Kamakura era supported the Honchi-suijaku theory as they were supposed to do.
Note that the anti-Honchi-suijaku theory was given its name by the scholars of the Showa era.
Suijakushin (the god of suijaku) and Honchibutu (the Buddha of honchi)
The Buddha, the identity of the gods, is called Honchibutsu.
Buddhas that are forcibly linked to Shinto gods are different from religion to religion, faith to faith, temple to temple and shrine to shrine.
Although the most popular Buddhist title granted to Japanese gods is Bosatsu (Bodhisattva), some of them--like Hachiman Daibosatsu, whose Honchibutsu title is Amida nyorai (Amitabha)--carry a Honchibutsu title that differs from the corresponding Buddhist title.
The following shows some of the relationships between Suijakushin and Honchibutsu:
Amaterasu = Dainichi nyorai (Vairocana) + Juichimen Kannon Bosatsu
Hachimanshin = Amida nyorai (Amitabha) = Emperor Ojin
Kumano Gongen = Amida nyorai (Amitabha)
Oyama kui no kami = Amaterasu omikami = Dainichi nyorai (Vairocana)
Ichikishima-hime = Benzaiten (Sarasvati)
Atagoo Gongen = Akiba Gongen = Jizo Bosatsu (Jizo Bodhisattva)
Susanoo = Gozu Tenno
Okuninushi = Daikokuten (Mahakala)
Tosho Daigongen (Ieyasu TOKUGAWA) = Yakushi nyorai (Bhaisaya)
Matsuo Taisha Shrine = Yakushi nyorai (Bhaisaya)
Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") was one of the Shogun positions in Japan's Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).
It was abolished in the Meiji Restoration.
It was one of the names given to the general dispatched to the eastern part of the country from the Nara period to the Heian period.
Also abbreviated to Shogun, Kubo, Taiju, Taijuko, Gosho, etc.
Although there were no posts called Seiju Taishogun or Seiban Taishogun, there were the similar posts of Seiteki Daishogun and Seisei Taishogun.
From the Kamakura period until the Edo period, it was the head of the Shogunate, a position held by the leader of the samurai families, and became hereditary to his descendants.
Although he was formally a retainer appointed by imperial edict, he was in fact the ruler of Japan who even held sway over the Imperial Court, and typically was treated as the king by outsiders.
'Seii' means 'to conquer the barbarians.'
The Seii Taishogun was a general appointed for conquering 'barbarians,' and led an army in an advance from the Pacific Ocean side.
A general who led an army's advance to the Japan Sea side was called Seiteki Daishogun, and one who led an army's advance into Kyushu was called Seisei Taishogun.
It is thought that this was an adaptation of the Sinocentrism of 'Shii' (four barbarians), 'toi, seiju, namban and hokuteki.'
In fact, at first it was called 'Seii' but from Hoki onward it became 'Seito,' and was again called 'Seii' from 793 on.
The first 'Seii Shogun' was appointed on September 29, 720, and was Tajihi Agatamori; the first 'Seito Taishogun' was appointed on December 7, 788, and was KI no Kosami.
The title of Shogun is not uniform in the records, with FUJIWARA no Umakai, for example, being 'Jisetsu Taishogun' at the time of his appointment, and 'Seii Jisetsu Taishi' at the time of his return to the Capital.
On July 13, 791, OTOMO no Otomaro was appointed Seito Taishi.
On February 17, 793, Seitoshi was changed to Seiishi.
'Shi' was also called 'Shogun,' and one school of thought says this is the first appearance of a Seii Taishogun, but the issue gets more complicated.
Below OTOMO no Otomaro was the Seito Fukushi/Seii Fukushi, SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro, who was appointed Seii Taishogun on November 5, 797.
Tamuramaro brought Aterui, of the Ezo of Isawa, who had fought stubbornly until then, back to the capital, thereby conquering that land.
Practically speaking, Tamuramaro can be seen as the first Seii Taishogun.
Later, on April 17 of 811, during a battle with the Ezo, FUNYA no Watamaro was appointed Seii Shogun, without the 'tai,' and on December 11 of that year reported the end of the conquest of the Ezo, and MONONOBE no Taritsugu, who had been Fukushogun, rose to Chinju Shogun (without the 'fu'), but on November 17, 814, became again Seii Shogun without the 'tai.'
In fact, below the Seii Taishogun were the posts of Seii Fukushogun, Seii Gungen, Seii Gunso, etc.
At first MINAMOTO no Yoritomo was nothing but the leader of the Kanto Bushidan (Kamakura-dono), and did not hold a position under the Ritsuryo system.
That is to say that at first he was only the head of a provincial insurrection, the same as TAIRA no Masakado.
That same Yoritomo's plan for a new government used as models the three governments of the Taira family, KISO Yoshinaka, and the provincial government of the Oshu Fujiwara clan, and it is thought that the form of the Kamakura government was molded out of comparative consideration of these.
Under the administration led by the Taira family, given that the position of court noble was already very high at the time, court nobles reached the height of their powers when the Taira family, part of the Taira clan, became court nobles.
In contrast to that, Yoritomo worked toward elevating the status of warriors themselves.
With respect to the Imperial Court, they sought a suitable position in order to establish the independent sovereignty of the warriors.
Yoshinaka KISO, who advanced into the central area and Kyoto, took the position called 'Seii Taishogun,' which had previously existed.
The position of Seii Taishogun had a hint of a mission to punish the eastern forces, and Yoshinaka's hidden intent to oppose Yoritomo has been surmised from that, but the Yoshinaka government was over very shortly (in fact, in recent years the story that says Yoshinaka was not 'Seii Taishogun' but 'Seito Taishogun' is gaining ground.
It is the later compilations such as "Azuma Kagami" and "Hyakurensho" that give him the title 'Seii Taishogun,' while "Gyokuyo" and "Sankaikoryonukigakiyo" (excerpts from "Sankaiki"), historical documents that were written at the time these events took place, have his title as 'Seito Taishogun.'
Furthermore, it is thought that, as a post that would conquer Yoritomo of Bando, 'Seito Taishogun,' a post previously taken by FUJIWARA no Tadabumi to conquer TAIRA no Masakado of Bando, was better than 'Seii Taishogun,' which conquered the Ezo of Ou.
The Oshu Fujiwara clan ruled the northeast region at that time, as it was an area to which the Imperial Court's rule did not extend.
The Oshu Fujiwara clan secured the position of 'Chinjufu Shogun' and called their own residence 'Yanagi no Gosho' or 'Ryuei.'
Ryuei is another name for the Shogunate.
The Chinjufu Shogun was granted regional autonomy in the form of military rule within Mutsu Province and Dewa Province, and as this position was formally one of an officer commanding the standing army on the border (in the case of the Seii Taishogun, it was commanding a temporary expeditionary force), it was not necessary for the holder of this title to live in Kyoto, which was very convenient for a regional leader.
This seems to have been the Yoritomo government in microcosm.
In 1190 Yoritomo was appointed to Ukone no Daisho (Udaisho) and had his own organs of household government approved as government offices.
However, the Konoe Daisho was required, by the nature of that position, to live in Kyoto, and was not suited to moving toward independence in Kanto.
Then Yoritomo resigned from Udaisho, and held onto those privileges as a former Udaisho.
It is thought that the notion of using the title of 'former Udaisho' for heads of state in the Kamakura government was not unheard of.
However, although the formal position of the post of Udaisho was high, compared to the rival KISO Yoshinaka, who was Seii Taishogun (or Seito Taishogun), as it was an officer of the central imperial guards, it was not a position for actively suppressing regional disturbances with military force.
Also, compared to the Oshu Fujiwara clan's Chinjufu Shogun, it lacked the important, active element of 'warrior's self-rule.'
What Yoritomo turned his attention to then was the office of 'Seii Taishogun.'
As military rule (regional sovereignty), it was the same as the Chinjufu Shogun.
However, given that the goal of this position was to lead the Bando soldiers (in this case, warriors from eastern Japan) to victory over the Ezo of Ou (in this case, the Oshu Fujiwara clan), it was traditionally a post superior to that of Chinjufu Shogun.
To put it another way, the Seii Taishogun was the one who placed a private position called Kamakura-dono to rule as a leader of the warriors of eastern Japan, Shugo and Jito throughout the country, was recognized as Udaisho with the authority to exercise military police powers, had family organs of clan governance treated the same as official government offices, and bundled it all together and officially secured it.
However, there is reason to believe that the post of Seii Taishogun was deemed necessary especially in the Oshu War to defeat the Oshu Fujiwara clan, and when he was in fact appointed in 1192 it had already lost its importance to Yoritomo.
Yoritomo was not in fact very attached to the Seii Taishogun post, and indicated his intent to resign 2 years later in 1194.
Also, MINAMOTO no Yoriie was his heir and right away was appointed to Sakone no Chujo, and then Saemon no Kami, and was proclaimed Seii Taishogun 3 years later.
Then at the time of the HIKI Yoshikazu Incident, the succession of the positions of Sotsuibushi and Sojito were in question, and the Shogun posts were not involved.
Consequently, at this stage the Shogun post was not an absolute requirement for leadership of the warrior families, and may not have been seen as that important.
On the other hand, the post of Shogun was proclaimed first when it came to succeeding MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.
When the Minamoto clan's Shoguns ended after the third one, Shoguns from regent families or royal Shoguns were installed as puppets and the regent Hojo clan held the real power.
From the Kamakura period on, after MINAMOTO no Yoritomo took the position of Seii Taishogun and started the Shogunate, the warrior families came to control Japanese politics.
Along with that Seii Taishogun was the highest authority of the warrior families and Japan's substantive sovereign.
Although it was originally a post bestowed by the Imperial Court, actual appointments, except for a time during the New Kemmu Government, were at the request of the person whose influence placed him at the pinnacle of samurai society.
Formally speaking, among the nobles it was recognized that the Court was the true government and the Shogunate was a temporary government in the provinces.
However, among warrior families that was not the case.
In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Akiie KITABATAKE of the Southern Court, as Chinjufu Shogun, was allowed to be called Chinjufu Taishogun, but it is thought that this was done to put it on a level with and oppose the Seii Taishogun.
Historical Traditions
It was customarily accepted by the warrior families that 'the families that could rise to Shogun, leader of the samurai, were limited to those extending from the Seiwa Genji.'
Because the Oda family claimed a connection with the Taira family, Nobunaga ODA was not able to become 'Seii Taishogun'; and when Ieyasu TOKUGAWA was appointed 'Seii Taishogun,' he falsified a connection to the Seiwa Minamoto clan; and there are other such tales.
However, Nobunaga ODA in fact received an imperial recommendation for 'appointment to Seii Taishogun,' so realistically there was no basis for the idea that one could not be Shogun if he was not from the Minamoto clan (it seems that the reason Ieyasu claimed Minamoto heritage was not only to become Shogun, but that by becoming the Minamoto clan chief and entering the post of Shogun, he would oppose Hideyoshi's warrior Kampaku system and aimed to gain authority to rule over both the warriors and the nobles).
Furthermore, even after Yoritomo, there are examples of regent Shogun and imperial Shogun, so it was not in fact limited to the Seiwa Minamoto clan.
All this can be interpreted to mean that someone from the Minamoto or Taira clans, or even from the noble Fujiwara clan, could become Seii Taishogun.
A recently popular explanation on the subject is that, since 'Seii Taishogun' was originally a post for leading soldiers of eastern Japan in conquest over the Ezo, the condition for assuming office was that he had to be 'someone who controls eastern Japan in some form.'
There are various opinions as to whether or not Nobunaga ODA wanted to be Seii Taishogun, but it is not possible to know for sure.
In fact, there is some speculation that what became a nominal qualification for the imperial recommendation for appointment to Seii Taishogun was that Nobunaga wiped out the Takeda clan, who were eastern Japan Daimyo, and effectively made the Hojo clan of Kanto subservient.
Also, there are those who say that Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI was not able to become Seii Taishogun because he lost to Ieyasu TOKUGAWA in the battles of Komaki and Nagakute.
However, Hideyoshi was appointed to Kampaku, a higher ranking position than Seii Taishogun.
For that reason, it is possible to speculate that Hideyoshi was not interested in the Shogun post, and wanted not a simple samurai government, but a new government that would subsumed the nobles.
On the other hand, there was previously, among the nobles, a tendency to view a person's pedigree - whether Minamoto or Taira clan - as 'Taira who are close to the nobles' or 'the warrior Minamoto clan who are difficult to control.'
Also stemming from this came the idea that the Minamoto and Taira clans, or the Minamoto and Taira families, alternately take control of political power in Japan (Gempei kotai shiso).
In fact, although there is an apocryphal tale that TAIRA no Tomomori and Mitsuhide AKECHI were appointed to Seii Taishogun, there is no historical evidence to indicate so.
