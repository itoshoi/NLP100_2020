In general, all alignments are treated as "certain" alignments, except those
that are parenthesized (to be explained later).

---- Function Words ----

1) Particles of Japanese words that correspond to subjects or direct objects
   in English should not be aligned.

   e.g.: J: 彼 は ご飯 を 食べ た
         E: He ate rice
         should not have "は" or "を" aligned to anything
   
   "で あ る" (is), "で あ っ た" (was), etc. are exceptions, with "で" being
   aligned.

2) English articles such as "the" and "a" should not be aligned to anything,
   except when the occur as part of a phrase that surrounds them on both sides

3) Punctuation may be aligned to words when necessary

   e.g.: J: 彼 は レストラン に 行き 、 ご飯 を 食べた
         E: He went to the restaurant and ate rice
         Here "、" should be aligned to "and"

4) A Japanse "particle + verb" phrase that acts as a preposition should be
   fully aligned to the preposition

    e.g.: J: それ は 彼 を 通じ て 報告 さ れ た
          E: It was announced through him
          Here "を 通じ て" should be aligned to "through"

---- Verbs ----

1) When there is only a verb in English, the whole verb phrase in Japanes should
   be aligned

   e.g.: J: 彼 は 食べ て い た
         E: He ate
         Here "ate" should be aligned to "食べ て い た"

2) When there is a verb and "be" or an auxiliary in English, the English verb
   should be aligned to the verb stem, and the rest of the verb phrase should
   be aligned to a modal.

   e.g.: J: 彼 は 食べ て い た
         E: He was eating
         Here, "eating" should align to "食べ" and "was" should align to 
         "て い た"

--- NOUNS ---

1) For phrases such as "hongan-ji temple" "本願 寺", "寺" should be aligned to 
   both words.

2) When there is parenthesized explanation that repeats the same semantic
   content twice (to indicate pronunciation, or to explain a foreign term),
   align the words to both the parenthesized and unparenthesized versions.
   Leave the parentheses unaligned. The parenthesized version will be treated
   as an optional alignment.

    e.g: J: 親鸞 （ しんらん ）
         E: shinran
　      "shinran" should be aligned to both "親鸞" and "しんらん"
