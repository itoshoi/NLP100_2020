Alignments created by Graham Neubig
alignment-tool.jar created by Soichiro Hayashi

This package includes alignment data for Japanese-English translation for use
with the Kyoto Free Translation task. It contains a total of 15 wikipedia
articles corresponding to the "tuning" section of the task.

The original alignment data was created by two bilingual annotators, and
re-checked for accuracy to ensure that it matched the annotation standard.

The alignments are also split into standard development and test sets so the
data may be used for experimenting with new alignment methods. The development
set consists of sections 001-008, while the test set consists of sections
009-015.

It includes:
standard.txt: A file describing the standard used to annotate alignments
data/
  japanese-*.txt:   The Japanese sentences (tokenized)
  english-*.txt:    The English sentences (tokenized and lower-cased)
  align-*.txt:      The alignment data created by taking the intersection
                    of both annotators, and performing a final quality check
                    to ensure that it matched the alignment standard
