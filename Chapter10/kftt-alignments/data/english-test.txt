yoshimitsu ashikaga was the 3rd seii taishogun of the muromachi shogunate and reigned from 1368 to1394 .
official rank : juichii daijodaijin ( chancellor of the realm ) and zoshoichii
title of nobility : monarch of japan
childhood name : haruo
his farther was the 2nd shogun , yoshiakira ashikaga , and his mother was ki no yoshiko .
his wife was nariko hino , a daughter of the dainagon ( great councilor ) tokimitsu hino , and she became his wife thanks to the arrangement and support of a beloved princess of the emperor go-kogon , senshi hino .
after that , yasuko hino ( later kitayamain ) , her niece , became his wife after the death of nariko .
his concubines were fujiwara no keishi ( yoshiko ) - mother of yoshimochi ashikaga and yoshinori ashikaga - and kasuga no tsubone ( a concubine of yoshimitsu ashikaga ) - mother of yoshitsugu ashikaga - among others .
yoshimitsu was also called " muromachi-dono " ( lord muromachi ) , because he moved the imperial palace to kitakoji muromachi .
later , " muromachi-dono " became the designation for the ashikaga shogun , and his government office-cum-residence was called " muromachi bakufu , " which has been used ever since as a historical term to indicate muromachi shogunate .
he was born in 1358 .
it fell precisely on the 100th day after the death of takauji ashikaga .
when yoshimitsu was young , there were constant struggles between the muromachi shogunate and the yoshino imperial court , and moreover , since the kanno disturbance , an internal conflict of the ashikaga family , had occurred , the strife between the shogunate and the court intensified .
kiyouji hosokawa and other potential military commanders supported the southern imperial court , and in 1361 , when kiyouji and masanori kusunoki of the southern imperial court occupied kyoto , yoshimitsu was obliged to escape to the shirahata castle in harima province .
the following year , he returned to kyoto as the alliance of the shogunate and northern court recaptured the capital . on the way back to kyoto , when he spent a night in settsu province , he liked the scenery and said to the vassals , " there is very fine scenery here , let 's carry it back to kyoto .
" you should carry it on your shoulders , " and the vassals , listening to him , were said to be very surprised at his grandiose thinking .
after his farther yoshiakira died from an illness in 1367 , yoshimitsu became the 3rd shogun at the age of 11 .
in 1368 the hyojohajime was celebrated , and in 1369 he was installed as shogun .
while the administration of the shogunate was led by shugo daimyos of the ashikaga clan , including yoriyuki hosokawa , who were in charge of kanrei , he studied imperial governance .
yoriyuki implemented oan no taiho , a land expropriation law , to consolidate land management , and developed the five mountain system in kyoto and kamakura to strengthen control over religion .
he also dispatched sadayo ( ryoshun ) imagawa and yoshihiro ouchi to kyushu , where the southern court dominated , to debilitate its influence and consolidate the power of the shogunate .
in 1374 , he welcomed yoriko hino as his wife .
in 1370 , in order to strengthen control over kyoto , the court gave him authority to control the sanmon kunin ( a clique of influential people of enryaku-ji temple and its affiliates , as well as member of the temple )
in 1378 , the shogunate was moved from sanjo bomon to kitanokoji muromachi .
the shogunate , after the move , was nicknamed " hana no gosho " ( flower palace ) , and also called the muromachi bakufu ( shogunate ) after its new location .
the administration and taxation authorities , which had been divided between the court and the shogunate , were integrated and a unit called hokoshu or bugyoshu was organized to handle practical matters , and was a standing army comparable to the shugo daimyo 's army in military strength .
he also undertook the following actions to demonstrate his power : visit to todai-ji temple and kofuku-ji temple in 1385 , sight-seeing trip to mt . fuji in suruga province in 1388 , visit to itsukushima shrine in aki province in 1389 .
in 1379 , yoshimitsu 's residence was surrounded by the anti-yoriyuki shugo daimyos such as yoshiyuki ( yoshimasa ) shiba and yoriaki toki , who requested that he dismiss yoriyuki , and consequently yoriyuki was dismissed ( koryaku political change ) .
yoshimasa succeeded to the post of kanrei and personnel matters were taken over by the shiba clique .
the shogunate issued an order to hunt and kill yoriyuki , but the following year pardoned him and after that he was included again in the administration with the post of shukuro , and during this period yoshimitsu was able to establish his power as shogun ; and based on these facts we can assume that he might have intended to make use of the rivalry between the two factions , shiba and hosokawa , to get them to contain each other .
after the death of yoriyasu , he subdued the toki clan , taking advantage of the internal conflict while the toki were fighting on two sides .
in 1391 , he intervened in the internal conflict of the yamashinas and provoked ujikiyo yamana , a powerful shugo daimyo dominating 11 provinces at that time who was called " rokubun no ichi dono " ( lord of one-sixth of the whole country ) to raise an army to subdue the yamanas .
yoshimitsu was again promoted and took the position of naidaijin ( minister of internal affairs ) and sadaijinn ( minister of the left ) , the higher official rankings that his grandfather and his father were not able to achieve .
in 1383 he was the first samurai to become genjichoja ( head of the genjis ) , and served concurrently as betto ( supreme officer ) of the junan-in and the shogaku-in , and later he was granted a title " jusango , " and reached the height of power of the samurai as well as the aristocrats .
in 1392 , yoshimitsu accelerated negotiations with the southern court with a help of yoshihiro ouchi as an intermediary , as the national influence of the southern court was declining . in the negotiations , he presented several following proposals for reconciliation : the emperor should be selected alternately from the two imperial lineages , jimyoin-to and daikakuji-to ; all the state-owned territories ( of which there was actually very little ) should belong to the daikakuji-to ; the three sacred treasures which were in the possession of emperor go-kameyama should be presented to emperor go-komatsu of the jimyoin-to , so that the southern court would be dissolved . in this way , he achieved integration of the northern and southern courts , and put a stop to the 58 year split between the courts .
after emperor go-enyu , who opposed yoshimitsu and abdicated to emperor go-komatsu , died in 1393 , yoshimitsu established his power , and in 1394 , he handed over the post of shogun to his son , yoshimochi ashikaga , and retired , but he continued to hold the real power .
the same year , he finally rose to the post of juichii daijodaijin ( chancellor of the realm ) .
the following year , he became a priest with a pseudonym , dogi .
it is thought that he became a priest in order to gain the ability to control temples and shrines , the remaining sphere he wanted to conquer after reaching the peak of the aristocratic spheres as seii taishogun , taisei daijin and junsangu .
following yoshimitsu 's act , many samurai and aristocrats also became priests .
in 1395 , sadayo imagawa , who held independent authority as kyushu tandai , was dismissed .
in 1399 , he provoked a powerful daimyo in the western region , yoshihiro ouchi , and using the excuse that yoshihiro was taking up arms , he subdued yoshihiro ( war of oei ) , and in this way the influential factions that might oppose yoshimitsu in the western region were eliminated .
yoshimitsu , since his younger days , had deeply admired ming , wishing to establish trade between japan and ming . however , the government of ming recognized prince kanenaga sole counterpart for negotiations , therefore , yoshimitsu 's wish was not fulfilled .
after the integration of the northern and southern courts , he again intended to negotiate with ming , under the nominal title of " seii shogun of japan , yoshimitsu minamoto , " but the government of ming would not accept an envoy dispatched by someone who presented himself as a vassal of the emperor , because ming traditionally did not trade with any retainer of a vassal .
then , yoshimitsu became a priest , and then sent a merchant called koitsumi from hakata city and the priest soa as missionaries to ming in 1401 , with the aristocratic title of " junsangu of japan , michiyoshi minamoto , " instead of using the higher ( but samurai ) title of " taisei shogun . "
finally emperor jianwen of ming offered a master-and-man relationship ( sakuho ) to the japanese sovereign instead of to prince kanenaga , with whom ming had wanted to have contact until then , and when ming gave the datongli calendar to japan , the two countries ' diplomatic relations were formally established .
in 1404 , he started japan-ming trade that took the form of tribute to the ming emperor . he also was able to suppress japanese pirates ( however , before the ming 's government could dispatch an envoy to convey the emperor 's gratitude to the japanese government , the seinan war broke out in ming , emperor jianwen abdicated , and emperor yongle took the throne ) .
after the abolition of the embassies to china , in the japanese aristocratic society , in which an isolation policy was practiced based on a petit sino centrism , there were accumulated discontent with and criticism of the tribute trade because japan was treated as vassal to the emperors of ming ; but , as the aristocrats were not able to speak out publicly in the face of the yoshimitsu 's strong influence , they could do nothing but comment on their dissatisfaction in diaries or other documents .
yoshimitsu , who adored ming culture , pressed the imperial court to use the chinese character 洪 in the name of japanese eras after the taizu of ming , emperor hongwu ( 洪武帝 ) , but this was rejected by for various reasons , including the facts mentioned above .
yoshimitsu felt offended , and after that , he was never allowed to change the name of the era during his reign , and that is why the oei was the longest era before meiji .
in 1397 , he received hokusantei in kitayama , kyoto , from kintsune saionji , and constructed a mountain villa called kitayamatei or kitayamadono ( later rokuon-ji temple ) , placing a reliquary in the center .
the culture of this period is called the kitayama culture , where the samurai style , aristocratic style and the tang style ( zen buddhism style ) were merged .
in 1408 , he died of a sudden illness in his 51st calendar year ( 49 years old ) .
buddhist name : rokuonin tenzan dogi .
after the death of yoshimitsu , the title " rokuonin daijohoo ( cloistered emperor ) " was granted from the imperial court , but his son yoshimochi , who became the fourth shogun , declined the offer partly because yoshiyuki ( yoshimasa ) shiba and others opposed accepting the title ( on the other hand , his family temple , shokoku-ji temple seems to have accepted the title and therefore , yoshimitsu 's name is registered as " rokuonin daijo tenno " in the temple 's death register ) .
it is said that during his life yoshimitsu did not get along well with his son yoshimochi , and the policies that yoshimitsu introduced , such as the imperial court policy , control of the aristocracy and shugo daimyo , and foreign policy including trade with ming , were denounced by yshimochi .
the hokusantei , a heritage left by yoshimitsu , was also destroyed by yoshimochi , except for the kinkaku .
in his life , yoshimitsu was extremely partial to yoshitsugu ashikaga , his second son , and when yoshitsugu absconded , yoshimochi accused him of treason and killed him .
afterwards , the descendants of yoshitsugu fled to echizen , and they were called " kuradanigosho . "
yoshimitsu 's son , yoshinori ashikaga , intended to continue yoshimitsu 's policies when he became the 6th shogun , but he was assassinated by mitsusuke akamatsu during the kakitsu war .
yoshimitsu 's grandson , yoshimasa ashikaga who became the 8th shogun , also tried to follow his grandfather and father 's policies , but as he became disgusted with the onin war and the puppet administration controlled by his vassals , he lost enthusiasm for political management .
the shugo daimyos , who had served submissively during yoshimitsu 's reign , began to take a defiant attitude toward the government again .
yoshinari tanaka , akira imatani , and others propose a theory that yoshimitsu had an intention to usurp the imperial throne ; and based on this theory , some novelists including chogoro kaionji and motohiko izawa present their opinion that yoshimitsu 's sudden death might confirm that he was assassinated to interrupt his plot .
yoshimitsu , from his younger days , was accustomed to using wither of two stylized signatures according to the situation , one for samurai affairs and the other for aristocratic affairs . he also made his second wife , yasuko , become the emperor go-komatsu 's junbo ( mother next to the empress , treated as his mother ) , then made her a nyoin ( wife of a former emperor or princess who received the same treatment as emperors ) . he also forced the nobles to offer their wives to him .
he also usurped various authorities , such as those for rituals and for personnel affairs , from the imperial family . in april 1408 , one month before his death , he carried out the ceremony of genpuku ( coming-of-age ceremony for boys ) for his second son , yoshitsugu , on a scale comparable to ceremonies for an imperial prince .
it is thought that all of this was done by yoshimitsu with the intention of usurping the throne , and becoming ming 's hosaku is also supposed to have been planned as a part of his plot , in order to make use of external pressure on the imperial court .
those who support the assassination theory suspect that yoshimitsu was poisoned by the imperial court , who wanted to prevent his usurpation ( izawa deduces in his novel that the assassin was zeami ) .
there is another theory in which yoshimochi 's side was worried about the future succession due to yoshimitsu 's excessive partiality to yoshitsugu .
however , there were no descriptions in any documents of that period , such as nobles ' diaries , indicating suspicion that the actions taken by yoshimitsu had been a part of his plot or that he was assassinated , and therefore , they cannot offer any direct evidence either .
by the way , usurpation here does not mean that yoshimitsu himself wanted to take to the throne , but he wanted to take authority from the emperors by acquiring power as a sort of retired sovereign , and intended to hold real power even after his retirement .
he tried to make his second son , yoshitsugu , accede to the throne , while he himself , being his father , intended to be a retired sovereign .
imatani supposes that yoshimitsu was strongly influenced by china ( ming ) , but he did not subscribe to idea that incumbent emperors could be overthrown by decree of heaven , instead making use of " yamataishi , " a popular prophecy of the time .
this verse is known as a prophecy , where it is predicted that the imperial reign would count 100 emperors , and according today 's study , the emperor go-komatsu is considered to be the 100th emperor .
however , because the reigns of the kobun , junnin , and chukyo were not recognized at the time , and the muromachi shogunate naturally saw the northern court as legitimate , emperor go-komatsu was considered to be the 99th .
but , if the temporary unification of emperor go-murakami in the shohei unification during the civil war of kanno is counted , then emperor go-komatsu is the 100th emperor .
thus , it could be interpreted to mean that japan would be ruined after a monkey or dog had been called a hero .
the idea that the imperial reign terminates with the 100th emperor is documented in gukansho by jien and other writings , and is supposed to have been widely accepted .
ujimitsu ashikaga , the kamakura kubo , was born in the year of the monkey , according to the chinese zodiac ( nowadays , he is considered to have been born in the year of boar ) , while yoshimitsu was born in the year of dog ; therefore , there was an interpretation that the monkey and the dog represent these two people .
on the other hand , izawa supposes that the author might have gotten the hint from the tale of genji .

information
located in the higashiyama ward of kyoto city , sanjyo-keihan station is a stop on the tozai line , a kyoto municipal subway line .
the station number is t11 .
the keihan electric railway
keihan main line and keihan oto line in sanjyo station ( in kyoto prefecture )
an underground concourse outside its ticket gate connects sanjyo-keihan station to sanjyo station .
the platform is located on the fourth underground level , as are the platforms of other stations on the tozai line . equipped with safety measures , the platform is what is known as an ' island platform , ' which is a single platform between double tracks ( one platform serving two tracks that run in opposite directions ) .
each station on the tozai line has its own color , and the color used at sanjyo-keihan station is scarlet tinged with purple .
refer to sanjyo-keihan for details on the station 's surroundings , including the location of the bus station .
kyoto city bus and other public transport firms have been calling this spot " sanjyo-keihan " since before the subway line was opened .
the municipal subway chose to use the name sanjyo-keihan because keihan was the name of another railway company and there was already a station named sanjyo in kyoto prefecture .
the station opened on october 12 , 1997 , when the tozai line began operating between daigo station and nijyo station .
on april 1 , 2007 , pitapa card was made available .
the station facilities were built by historical corporation of tozai line of kyoto municipal subway lines , a third sector company .
the keihan keishin line uses the same tracks as the tozai line . they originally planned to share the tracks to this station because the keihan keishin line ran between misasagi station and this station , which was above ground at the time . however , as they were unable to secure enough space around this area for a turnaround , the keihan keishin line decided to extend the shared section to the next station , kyoto shiyakusyo-mae , when sanjyo-keihan station was opened . ( they later extended the shared section even further to uzumasa tenjingawa station when the tozai line was extended to that station in 2008 . )

sanyodo ( senyodo or kagetomo-no-michi ) can mean :
a region of honshu along the seto inland sea that was one of the goki-shichido ( literally , " five provinces and seven circuits " ) administrative divisions .
a highway that traversed sanyodo , which was one of the goki-shichido .
a route built during the ritsuryo period .
a route built in the edo period ( saigoku-kaido ) .
an abbreviation for " sanyo jidoshado expressway . "
administrative division
see also : list of ryoseikoku
one of the goki-shichido , referring to a region of honshu along the seto inland sea
the region west of kinai and along the seto inland sea , from present-day west hyogo prefecture to yamaguchi prefecture , was collectively called sanyodo .

bizen-no-kuni

nagato-no-kuni
during the ritsuryo period the sanyodo connected kinai ( naniwa-kyo , heijo-kyo , and heian-kyo ) and north kyushu ( dazaifu and hakata ) .
the sanyodo was only the first graded highway among the shichido , and as such it was regarded as the most important because of the expected passage and stays of foreign missions .
the eastern end of the road varied in response to the transfer of capitals such as heijo-kyo and heian-kyo .
the ancient sanyodo was approximately six to nine meters wide and generally straight in such a way that kokufu and other areas throughout the region could be connected efficiently .
the sanyodo stretched northwest from harima-no-kuni to mimasaka-no-kuni , which was away from the main route .
the edo shogunate improved the sanyodo as part of its road maintenance policy , which focused on five major highways .
there were 42 yadoeki along the highway .
during the edo period , the sanyodo ( otherwise known as saigoku-kaido ) connected kyoto to shimonoseki city and further extended to kokura city by crossing the kammon-kaikyo strait from shimonoseki .
this route was part of the truck line linking edo and nagasaki city .
the meiji government started its road management system by assigning numbers to national highways .
during the meiji period , the sanyodo of the edo period and earlier became a section of national highway 3 connecting tokyo city and kobe city ( separating from national highway 2 in kyoto city ) ; and of national highway 4 connecting tokyo and nagasaki city ; during the taisho period it was integrated into national highway 2 connecting tokyo and kagoshima city ( separating from national highway 1 in mie prefecture ) .
the sanyodo has been passed down to national highway 2 today , which connects osaka city and kita kyushu city .
its route , however , differs from that of the ritsuryo and edo periods in many places .
national highway 2 from okayama city ( okayama prefecture ) to fukuyama city ( hiroshima prefecture ) takes a very different route ( kamogata-orai route ) .
the sanyo jidoshado expressway and the railway lines of the sanyo main line and the sanyo shinkansen line roughly follow the historical sanyodo .
the sanyodo has served its function of connecting the kinki region and kyushu since the ritsuryo period , and it continues in that manner today .
when people say " sanyodo " today , they are generally referring to the sanyo jidoshado highway .
the historical sanyodo and the roads running in parallel with it are collectively called " old sanyodo " in okayama prefecture and east hiroshima prefecture , because national highway 2 does not follow it between okayama city ( okayama prefecture ) and fukuyama city ( hiroshima prefecture ) .
kurama-dera temple is a buddhist temple located in kurama honmachi , sakyo ward , kyoto city , kyoto prefecture .
it used to belong to tendai sect , but since 1949 it became independent and is now the head temple of kurama-kokyo sect .
sango is mount kurama .
it is said to have been established by gantei , a leading disciple of ganjin .
in this temple , the honzon ( main image of worship ) is referred to as " sonten . "
" sonten " is said to be the honzon that is a trinity of vaisravana , saharabhuja and goho maoson .
is located at the north of kyoto basin , on the sourthern slope of mount kurama , where rich natural environment remains .
kurama is also famous as the place where ushiwakamaru ( minamoto no yoshitsune ) trained himself , and it is also known as the setting for jiro osaragi 's book , " kurama tengu . "
it is the no. 19 new saigoku kannon pilgrimage site .
it operates a cable car ( mount kurama cable railway ) transportation to kurama temple , and it is the only religious corporation which operates a railway business .
various books including " konjaku monogatarishu " and " fusoryakuki " describe the beginning of kurama temple , and it is said that a person named fujiwara no isendo , who came from fujiwara nanke and served as the head of zoto-ji temple , enshrined vaisravana and sahasrabhuja , and built kurama temple .
however , " anbagaiji engi " , handed down for many generations in the temple , tells another story about the start of the temple , which is that gantei , a high disciple of ganjin , built a cottage in the 1st year of hoki , and enshrined vaisravana .
gantei was the youngest among the eight high disciples who ganjin brought back with him from tang ( present day china ) .
one night , in the third year of hoki , gantei saw a spiritual dream , which told him that there is a spiritual mountain in the north of yamashiro province .
gantei , who set off to visit the spiritual mountain , saw a white horse with a saddle made by treasures on top of a mountain .
that was mount kurama .
gantei , on entering the mountain , was attacked and nearly killed by an ogre who took the form of a woman , but when he was in extreme danger , a dead tree fell down and crushed the ogre .
the next morning , a statue of vaisravana was there , and it is said that gantei built a temple to worship this statue .
this story about gantei is only seen in " anbagaiji engi " , and it is not clear how far it tells an actual historical event .
nevertheless , it is notable that a priest of south capital ( nara ) took part in establishing the temple , as in the case of the establishment of kiyomizutemple .
later , in 796 , fujiwara no isendo , who was in charge of building an official temple , to-ji temple , wished to build a temple to place a kannon that he personally worshiped .
isendo , in accordance with a message revealed to him in a spiritual dream one night , followed a white horse and arrived at mount kurama , upon which he saw a small shrine that housed vaisravana .
isendo became suspicious saying , " i worship kannon , but it is vaisravana that is worshipped here . "
however , in his dream that night , a child appeared and told him that " kannon and vaisravana have different names , but fundamentally they are one and the same . "
thus it is said that isendo made a statue of sahasrabhuja and enshrined it together with vaisravana .
kurama-dera temple became a temple of shingon sect from around the time when priest buen of to-ji temple entered kurama temple during kanpyo era ( from 889 to 897 ) at the end of the 9th century , but it changed to tendai sect in the 12th century ; since then it has been under the control of shoren-in for a long time .
it appears to have attracted worshippers widely during the latter half of heian period , as can seen by the fact that emperor shirakawa came to worship in 1091 and moromichi fujiwara , the kanpaku , in 1099 .
" the pillow book " names the front approach of ninety-nine prayers of kurama temple as an example of " something which is near but also far " .
kurama temple has been burned down many times , including by the fire of year 1126 .
in 1812 ( ninth year of bunka of edo period ) , there was a great fire that engulfed the whole mountain in flames , and more recently , the main shrine was burned down by a fire in year 1945 .
therefore , all the buildings are new , but many cultural properties such as statues of the buddha have been preserved .
koun shigaraki , a chief priest in the showa era , started kurama-kokyo sect in 1947 .
in 1949 the temple became independent from tendai sect and is now the head temple of kurama-kokyo sect .
in mount kurama , located in the mountains of kyoto , mountain ascetic hermits actively practiced vajrayana buddhism .
therefore , it is said that tengus , who are spirits of the mountains , live in kurama .
the highest-ranking tengu that lives in kurama is called sojobo , and mount kurama is said to be one of the most supreme mountains for tengu .
kurama-dera temple , located north of kyoto , was initially a temple with vaisravana ( of the four heavenly kings , the king protecting the north-side ) as its honzon , and it also enshrined saharabhuja and goho maoson .
however , form of worship at the current kurama temple after the establishment of kurama-kokyo is unique , and some explanation is necessary regarding its honzon .
according to the explanation by the temple after the establishment of kurama-kokyo , the honzon of kurama temple main shrine golden hall ( the main shrine ) is said to be " sonten . "
within the shrine , vaisravana is enshrined in the center , saharabhuja is on the right side facing it , and goho maoson on the left side , and the three are collectively referred to as " sonten . "
" sonten " is said to be " the cosmic energy that gives lfe and existence . "
moreover , vaisravana represents the spirit of sunlight that symbolizes " light " saharabhujarepresents the sprit of moonlight that symbolizes " love " , and maoson represents the spiritual king of earth that symbolizes " power . "
the power of " sonten " is believed to exist everywhere , and since this power is especially strong in this area kurama-dera temple is said to be a place of practice where one can be surrounded by such power .
it is said that goho maoson , one of the sonten , came to earth from venus 6.5 million years ago ( not " 650 years " ago ) ; its body is formed from elements different from those ordinary human beings , and it is said to be in an eternal existence at the age of 16 and it does not age .
vaisravana , saharabhuja and goho maoson that are enshrined in golden hall of the main shrine are all secret buddha statues [ not open for public viewing ] ; in their stead statues referred to as " omae-dachi " are enshrined in front of these secret buddha statues .
omae-dachi maoson statue looks like an unworldly person , with wings on its back , and a long beard , and has a high nose .
the aureola is made from tree leaves .
goho maoson enshrined in two-storied pagoda has a similar form .
therefore , it is believed that " kurama tengu " was initially goho maoson .
although it is said to be 16 years old , it looks aged .
nio-mon was burned down in 1891 , and rebuilt in 1911 .
the cable car from sanmon station to tahoto station started operating in 1957 .
tahoto was rebuilt in 1959 .
great hall was rebuilt in year 1971 .
shinden was built in 1924 .
tenhorindo hall was rebuilt in 1969 .
mao-den of penetralia is a small shrine on top of a oddly-shaped rock located on a mountain road on the way from the main shrine to kibune shrine in the west .
it enshrines maoson , which is said to have arrived on earth from venus 6.5 million years ago .
the current building was rebuilt after being burnt down in 1945 .
reihoden hall is located at the back of the main shrine .
on the 1st floor there is kuramayama museum , which has an exhibition of the animals and plants of mount kurama .
the 2nd floor houses temple treasure exhibit room and yosano memorial hall , which exhibits articles , and other items left by tekkan yosano and akiko yosano ( koun shigaraki , who started kurama-kokyo sect , was a poet who studied under the yosano 's ) .
on the 3rd floor there is a sanctuary of buddhist statues , which exhibits cultural properties including three standing statues : wooden statue of bishamonten , wooden statue of kosshouten , and wooden statue of zennishi-doji .
there is a view that the honzon of kurama-dera temple were these three statues of bishamonten , and there is another view that the honzon probably looked similar to the tobatsu-bishamonten of the latter half of heian era , which is an important cultural property ; this statue is also enshrined in reihoden hall .
articles excavated from the ruin of kyozuka , which are items born from the idea of the latter day of the law during the latter half of the heian period can also be seen here .
also , akiko yosano 's library , named " tohaku-tei " , has been moved from its original location and reconstructed in front of reihoden hall .
wooden statue of bishamonten , wooden statue of kosshouten , and wooden statue of zennishi-doji .

kuramo no himatsuri / kurama fire festival ( october 22nd ) is a festival of yuki shrine , located close to nio-mon .
this is not sponsored by kurama-dera temple .
from within kyoto city to the front of kurama temple .
from demachiyanagi station of eizan electric railway , kurama line , it takes approximately 30 minutes to arrive at kurama station .
it takes 1 minute by foot to go from the station to nio-mon ( main gate ) .
from nio-mon to main shrine golden hall ( on foot ) .
nio-mon ( 0 ) - 287m - yuki shrine ( 50 ) - 791m - main shrine golden hall ( 160 )
the numbers in brackets are altitude measurements based on that of nio-mon ( unit : m ) .
the road is basically unpaved mountain road , although it is partially paved by stone .
it will take a grown man about 30 minutes to travel all the way on foot .
from nio-mon to main shrine golden hall ( by cable car ) .
nio-mon ( sanmon station ) ( 0 ) - 200m - tahoutou station ( 120 ) - 456m - main shrine golden hall ( 160 )
the numbers in brackets are altitudes measurements based on that of nio-mon ( unit : m ) .
because it is hard to visit and worship on foot for the elderly people , cable car ( mount kurama cable railway ) is operates between nio-mon and two-storied pagoda .
the time spent in the cable car is only about 2 minutes , and those who contribute 100 yen to the temple can ride the cable car for free ( essentially , the fare is 100 yen one way ) .
from the two-storied pagoda to main shrine golden hall , you need to walk about 10 minutes on a stone paved road .
if you are visiting and worshipping on foot , you need to go via yuki shrine .
the temple encourages people who can walk the distance , not to use the cable car and visit and worship the temple on foot .
access from kibune side

the entrance from kibune side is called nishi-mon .
this route is said to be the route that ushiwakamaru ran , when he trained with tengu .
as you will be crossing one mountain , it will be harder than climbing from the kurama side .
it will take about 50 minutes on foot , even for a grown man .

honchi-suijaku is one of the thoughts of shinbutsu-shugo ( the amalgamation of buddhism with shinto ) that emerged during the era in which buddhism flourished in japan ; it supports the view that yao yorozu no kami ( eight million gods ) are gongens , the embodiment of various types of buddhas ( including bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) and tenbu ( deva ) ) , which appeared in the land that was japan .
summary
honchi indicates the state of enlightenment , while suijaku , which literally means " bringing down jaku ( ato ) , " indicates the appearance of shinto and buddhist deities .
the ultimate honchi is considered to be hossin ( the truth of the universe ) and is therefore called honchi-hossin .
as the " gon " of gongen means " provisional " or " temporary , " as shown in " gon-dainagon ( an acting chief councilor of state ) , gongen indicates a buddha that has tentatively appeared in the form of a god .
the concept of honchi originated from the inclusive nature of buddhism , which encompassed a wide range of indigenous religions as it spread throughout the region .
this is evidenced by the fact that most buddhist tenbu ( deva ) gods originate from hindu , india 's indigenous religion .
the thought also gave rise to a theory of esoteric buddhism ( of the later mahayana buddhism ) that kajishin like fudo myo-o ( acala ) is the embodiment of dainichi nyorai ( vairocana ) .
on the other hand , the concept of suijaku came from a chinese character , 迹 ( jaku ) , which first appeared in the tenun chapter of " soshi ( zhuang-zi ) " or in its phrase of ' 所以迹 ' ( the path of edification ) , and was later referred to by guo xiang of west jin , the writer of " zhuang-zi commentary " who developed his own theory in the chapter of " seong-wang ( daiseigaio ) " and defined jaku as a royal reign , citing " 所以迹 " as a born saint .
it was seng-zhao , of the late qin , who first brought the concept to buddhism .
seng-zhao cited , in his writing " chuyuimakitsukyo ( vimalak ? rti sutra commentary ) , " the idea of " honmatsu , " which had been referred to by wang bi of wei , and other scholars replaced the word " 所以迹 " with " 本 " ( hon ) and defined it ( hon ) as an unfathomable nirvana ( enlightenment ) achieved by bodhisattva and " 迹 " ( jaku ) as a means to enlighten people , as used by bodhisattva .
his theory , as endorsed by hokekyo ( lotus sutra ) , which supports kuon jitsujo--a view that buddha had been in nirvana long before he was born into this world--further influenced zhiyi of the chinese tendai sect , thus providing a basis for the development of hokekyo 's educational interpretations and the division of its scripture into " jaku-mon " ( the first half ) and " hon-mon " ( the second half ) .
this created a widely accepted view that hon is the buddha or enlightenment itself while jaku is simply a means by which to save and enlighten people .
in japan , as is evident in the confrontation between the mononobe clan and the soga clan during the nara era , there has been a dividing line between shinto and buddhism since it was officially introduced to japan .
however , the line was gradually eroded as the buddhists took the view that shinto gods are a kind of lost , poor people , like the tenbu ( deva ) gods .
they tried to raise their status to that of the buddha by leaving copies of sutras at temples or doing doso , officially acknowledging the gods ' achievements and stating in oracles that they would no longer stay as a god thanks to buddha 's good deeds .
in the tenmu period of the late seventh century , when the emperor-centered political regime was put in place , the shinto gods that had played important roles in building the country--including amaterasu omikami , the highest ranking ujigami ( local god ) of all--were elevated in status to ethnic gods , and this encouraged buddhists to give them higher ranking as a token of respect .
because these gods were considered to be members of the goho zenjin , a group of gods who respected and guarded the buddhist law , some were even granted bosatsu-go ( the title of bodhisattva ) from the end of the nara era through the heian era .
a typical example of this is hachimanshin , a famous ethnic god also known as hachiman daibosatsu .
however , some low-profile minor ethnic gods , like the spirits of nature and death , to whom the honchi-suijaku theory was not applied , were treated differently .
they are , for example , jitsurui no kami ( jitsurui gods ) or jissha no kami ( jissha gods ) , as opposed to gonsha no kami .
to make their position clear , some buddhists codified a warning that permitted people to respect gongeshin but not jitsurui no kami .
this must have been an intentional effort to keep buddhism separate from shinto .
the theory of honji-suijaku affected art and architecture , giving birth to honchi-suijaku zuga ( pictures ) and gongen-zukuri ( buildings ) , and during the middle and end of the kamakura era it affected literature as well , resulting in a series of works called honchimono .
by the middle of the kamakura era there appeared a group of people who insisted in the shinpon butsujaku theory that buddhas were in turn the embodiment of shinto gods and that shinto gods were the masters that buddhas followed .
this theory was originated by shinto people who had complained about buddhism , which had been dominant over shinto , and wanted shinto to achieve independent status from it .
the watarai clan , who had served as priests of gegu ( the outer shrine of ise jingo ) organized and re-edited myths and the records of shinto ceremonies in order to compile the shinto gobusho ( five-volume apologia of shinto ) ; their work laid the foundation for ise watarai shinto .
additionally , an attempt was made to theorize shinto by borrowing the doctrine of the tendai sect , which had adopted the reality-affirming hongaku philosophy , and to re-edit several kinds of theory books by falsely attributing them to kukai ; but later these works were organized by yukitada and ieyuki watarai .
from the period of the northern and southern courts through the muromachi era , the anti-honchi-suijaku theory increasingly gained ground to the point where some monks of the tendai sect supported it .
jihen , the author of " kujihongi gengi " and " toyowashihara shinpuwaki , " converted to shinto ; and ryohen of the tendai sect , the author of " jindai no maki shikenbun " and " tenchi reiki kibunsho , " supported his theory .
following these moves , kanetomo yoshida wrote the book titled " yuiitsu shinto myoho yoshu ( the only shinto scripture ) , " making jihen 's theory more complete and comprehensive .
however , new buddhist schools that emerged during the kamakura era supported the honchi-suijaku theory as they were supposed to do .
note that the anti-honchi-suijaku theory was given its name by the scholars of the showa era .
suijakushin ( the god of suijaku ) and honchibutu ( the buddha of honchi )
the buddha , the identity of the gods , is called honchibutsu .
buddhas that are forcibly linked to shinto gods are different from religion to religion , faith to faith , temple to temple and shrine to shrine .
although the most popular buddhist title granted to japanese gods is bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) , some of them--like hachiman daibosatsu , whose honchibutsu title is amida nyorai ( amitabha ) --carry a honchibutsu title that differs from the corresponding buddhist title .
the following shows some of the relationships between suijakushin and honchibutsu :
amaterasu = dainichi nyorai ( vairocana ) + juichimen kannon bosatsu
hachimanshin = amida nyorai ( amitabha ) = emperor ojin
kumano gongen = amida nyorai ( amitabha )
oyama kui no kami = amaterasu omikami = dainichi nyorai ( vairocana )
ichikishima-hime = benzaiten ( sarasvati )
atagoo gongen = akiba gongen = jizo bosatsu ( jizo bodhisattva )
susanoo = gozu tenno
okuninushi = daikokuten ( mahakala )
tosho daigongen ( ieyasu tokugawa ) = yakushi nyorai ( bhaisaya )
matsuo taisha shrine = yakushi nyorai ( bhaisaya )
seii taishogun ( literally , " great general who subdues the barbarians " ) was one of the shogun positions in japan 's ryoge no kan ( class outside of the ritsuryo system ) .
it was abolished in the meiji restoration .
it was one of the names given to the general dispatched to the eastern part of the country from the nara period to the heian period .
also abbreviated to shogun , kubo , taiju , taijuko , gosho , etc .
although there were no posts called seiju taishogun or seiban taishogun , there were the similar posts of seiteki daishogun and seisei taishogun .
from the kamakura period until the edo period , it was the head of the shogunate , a position held by the leader of the samurai families , and became hereditary to his descendants .
although he was formally a retainer appointed by imperial edict , he was in fact the ruler of japan who even held sway over the imperial court , and typically was treated as the king by outsiders .
' seii ' means ' to conquer the barbarians . '
the seii taishogun was a general appointed for conquering ' barbarians , ' and led an army in an advance from the pacific ocean side .
a general who led an army 's advance to the japan sea side was called seiteki daishogun , and one who led an army 's advance into kyushu was called seisei taishogun .
it is thought that this was an adaptation of the sinocentrism of ' shii ' ( four barbarians ) , ' toi , seiju , namban and hokuteki . '
in fact , at first it was called ' seii ' but from hoki onward it became ' seito , ' and was again called ' seii ' from 793 on .
the first ' seii shogun ' was appointed on september 29 , 720 , and was tajihi agatamori ; the first ' seito taishogun ' was appointed on december 7 , 788 , and was ki no kosami .
the title of shogun is not uniform in the records , with fujiwara no umakai , for example , being ' jisetsu taishogun ' at the time of his appointment , and ' seii jisetsu taishi ' at the time of his return to the capital .
on july 13 , 791 , otomo no otomaro was appointed seito taishi .
on february 17 , 793 , seitoshi was changed to seiishi .
' shi ' was also called ' shogun , ' and one school of thought says this is the first appearance of a seii taishogun , but the issue gets more complicated .
below otomo no otomaro was the seito fukushi / seii fukushi , sakanoue no tamuramaro , who was appointed seii taishogun on november 5 , 797 .
tamuramaro brought aterui , of the ezo of isawa , who had fought stubbornly until then , back to the capital , thereby conquering that land .
practically speaking , tamuramaro can be seen as the first seii taishogun .
later , on april 17 of 811 , during a battle with the ezo , funya no watamaro was appointed seii shogun , without the ' tai , ' and on december 11 of that year reported the end of the conquest of the ezo , and mononobe no taritsugu , who had been fukushogun , rose to chinju shogun ( without the ' fu ' ) , but on november 17 , 814 , became again seii shogun without the ' tai . '
in fact , below the seii taishogun were the posts of seii fukushogun , seii gungen , seii gunso , etc .
at first minamoto no yoritomo was nothing but the leader of the kanto bushidan ( kamakura-dono ) , and did not hold a position under the ritsuryo system .
that is to say that at first he was only the head of a provincial insurrection , the same as taira no masakado .
that same yoritomo 's plan for a new government used as models the three governments of the taira family , kiso yoshinaka , and the provincial government of the oshu fujiwara clan , and it is thought that the form of the kamakura government was molded out of comparative consideration of these .
under the administration led by the taira family , given that the position of court noble was already very high at the time , court nobles reached the height of their powers when the taira family , part of the taira clan , became court nobles .
in contrast to that , yoritomo worked toward elevating the status of warriors themselves .
with respect to the imperial court , they sought a suitable position in order to establish the independent sovereignty of the warriors .
yoshinaka kiso , who advanced into the central area and kyoto , took the position called ' seii taishogun , ' which had previously existed .
the position of seii taishogun had a hint of a mission to punish the eastern forces , and yoshinaka 's hidden intent to oppose yoritomo has been surmised from that , but the yoshinaka government was over very shortly ( in fact , in recent years the story that says yoshinaka was not ' seii taishogun ' but ' seito taishogun ' is gaining ground .
it is the later compilations such as " azuma kagami " and " hyakurensho " that give him the title ' seii taishogun , ' while " gyokuyo " and " sankaikoryonukigakiyo " ( excerpts from " sankaiki " ) , historical documents that were written at the time these events took place , have his title as ' seito taishogun . '
furthermore , it is thought that , as a post that would conquer yoritomo of bando , ' seito taishogun , ' a post previously taken by fujiwara no tadabumi to conquer taira no masakado of bando , was better than ' seii taishogun , ' which conquered the ezo of ou .
the oshu fujiwara clan ruled the northeast region at that time , as it was an area to which the imperial court 's rule did not extend .
the oshu fujiwara clan secured the position of ' chinjufu shogun ' and called their own residence ' yanagi no gosho ' or ' ryuei . '
ryuei is another name for the shogunate .
the chinjufu shogun was granted regional autonomy in the form of military rule within mutsu province and dewa province , and as this position was formally one of an officer commanding the standing army on the border ( in the case of the seii taishogun , it was commanding a temporary expeditionary force ) , it was not necessary for the holder of this title to live in kyoto , which was very convenient for a regional leader .
this seems to have been the yoritomo government in microcosm .
in 1190 yoritomo was appointed to ukone no daisho ( udaisho ) and had his own organs of household government approved as government offices .
however , the konoe daisho was required , by the nature of that position , to live in kyoto , and was not suited to moving toward independence in kanto .
then yoritomo resigned from udaisho , and held onto those privileges as a former udaisho .
it is thought that the notion of using the title of ' former udaisho ' for heads of state in the kamakura government was not unheard of .
however , although the formal position of the post of udaisho was high , compared to the rival kiso yoshinaka , who was seii taishogun ( or seito taishogun ) , as it was an officer of the central imperial guards , it was not a position for actively suppressing regional disturbances with military force .
also , compared to the oshu fujiwara clan 's chinjufu shogun , it lacked the important , active element of ' warrior 's self-rule . '
what yoritomo turned his attention to then was the office of ' seii taishogun . '
as military rule ( regional sovereignty ) , it was the same as the chinjufu shogun .
however , given that the goal of this position was to lead the bando soldiers ( in this case , warriors from eastern japan ) to victory over the ezo of ou ( in this case , the oshu fujiwara clan ) , it was traditionally a post superior to that of chinjufu shogun .
to put it another way , the seii taishogun was the one who placed a private position called kamakura-dono to rule as a leader of the warriors of eastern japan , shugo and jito throughout the country , was recognized as udaisho with the authority to exercise military police powers , had family organs of clan governance treated the same as official government offices , and bundled it all together and officially secured it .
however , there is reason to believe that the post of seii taishogun was deemed necessary especially in the oshu war to defeat the oshu fujiwara clan , and when he was in fact appointed in 1192 it had already lost its importance to yoritomo .
yoritomo was not in fact very attached to the seii taishogun post , and indicated his intent to resign 2 years later in 1194 .
also , minamoto no yoriie was his heir and right away was appointed to sakone no chujo , and then saemon no kami , and was proclaimed seii taishogun 3 years later .
then at the time of the hiki yoshikazu incident , the succession of the positions of sotsuibushi and sojito were in question , and the shogun posts were not involved .
consequently , at this stage the shogun post was not an absolute requirement for leadership of the warrior families , and may not have been seen as that important .
on the other hand , the post of shogun was proclaimed first when it came to succeeding minamoto no sanetomo .
when the minamoto clan 's shoguns ended after the third one , shoguns from regent families or royal shoguns were installed as puppets and the regent hojo clan held the real power .
from the kamakura period on , after minamoto no yoritomo took the position of seii taishogun and started the shogunate , the warrior families came to control japanese politics .
along with that seii taishogun was the highest authority of the warrior families and japan 's substantive sovereign .
although it was originally a post bestowed by the imperial court , actual appointments , except for a time during the new kemmu government , were at the request of the person whose influence placed him at the pinnacle of samurai society .
formally speaking , among the nobles it was recognized that the court was the true government and the shogunate was a temporary government in the provinces .
however , among warrior families that was not the case .
in the period of the northern and southern courts , akiie kitabatake of the southern court , as chinjufu shogun , was allowed to be called chinjufu taishogun , but it is thought that this was done to put it on a level with and oppose the seii taishogun .
historical traditions
it was customarily accepted by the warrior families that ' the families that could rise to shogun , leader of the samurai , were limited to those extending from the seiwa genji . '
because the oda family claimed a connection with the taira family , nobunaga oda was not able to become ' seii taishogun ' ; and when ieyasu tokugawa was appointed ' seii taishogun , ' he falsified a connection to the seiwa minamoto clan ; and there are other such tales .
however , nobunaga oda in fact received an imperial recommendation for ' appointment to seii taishogun , ' so realistically there was no basis for the idea that one could not be shogun if he was not from the minamoto clan ( it seems that the reason ieyasu claimed minamoto heritage was not only to become shogun , but that by becoming the minamoto clan chief and entering the post of shogun , he would oppose hideyoshi 's warrior kampaku system and aimed to gain authority to rule over both the warriors and the nobles ) .
furthermore , even after yoritomo , there are examples of regent shogun and imperial shogun , so it was not in fact limited to the seiwa minamoto clan .
all this can be interpreted to mean that someone from the minamoto or taira clans , or even from the noble fujiwara clan , could become seii taishogun .
a recently popular explanation on the subject is that , since ' seii taishogun ' was originally a post for leading soldiers of eastern japan in conquest over the ezo , the condition for assuming office was that he had to be ' someone who controls eastern japan in some form . '
there are various opinions as to whether or not nobunaga oda wanted to be seii taishogun , but it is not possible to know for sure .
in fact , there is some speculation that what became a nominal qualification for the imperial recommendation for appointment to seii taishogun was that nobunaga wiped out the takeda clan , who were eastern japan daimyo , and effectively made the hojo clan of kanto subservient .
also , there are those who say that hideyoshi toyotomi was not able to become seii taishogun because he lost to ieyasu tokugawa in the battles of komaki and nagakute .
however , hideyoshi was appointed to kampaku , a higher ranking position than seii taishogun .
for that reason , it is possible to speculate that hideyoshi was not interested in the shogun post , and wanted not a simple samurai government , but a new government that would subsumed the nobles .
on the other hand , there was previously , among the nobles , a tendency to view a person 's pedigree - whether minamoto or taira clan - as ' taira who are close to the nobles ' or ' the warrior minamoto clan who are difficult to control . '
also stemming from this came the idea that the minamoto and taira clans , or the minamoto and taira families , alternately take control of political power in japan ( gempei kotai shiso ) .
in fact , although there is an apocryphal tale that taira no tomomori and mitsuhide akechi were appointed to seii taishogun , there is no historical evidence to indicate so .
