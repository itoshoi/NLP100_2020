college
outline
kyoto institute of technology ( kit ) has only one school , that is , school of science and technology , so it 's not that big in scale , but its education and research are unique in pursuing " practical science " based on creating products , ranging widely from the cutting-edge science and technology , such as biotechnology , material , information , and environment , to formative arts and design .
and , having the departments related to art , kit tries " the fusion of science and art " through its organic education curriculum , attempting to become an international , sensibility-rich institute .
history
in 1899 , kyoto college of textile fibers was founded .
in 1902 , kyoto college of technology was founded .
in 1914 , kyoto institute of textile fibers was founded .
in 1931 , kyoto institute of textile fibers was renamed kyoto institute of textile thread .
in 1944 , kyoto college of technology was renamed kyoto vocational college of technology , and kyoto institute of textile thread was renamed kyoto vocational college of textile .
in 1949 , based on two vocational colleges above , kit started as a college under the new system , and opened school of engineering and design , and school of textile science .
in 1951 , technical college of kit was established within the premises .
in 1992 , technical college of kit was closed .
in 2004 , kit was transformed into the national university corporation by the national university corporation law .
in 2006 , school of engineering and design , and school of textile science were united into school of science and technology .
